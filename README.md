This is the center of Source Network's documentation.

## Getting started

```
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

This installs necessary dependencies and starts a local development server.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

Documentation is written using [common markdown syntax](https://commonmark.org/help/) or [MDX syntax](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/#mdx-syntax) - the file extension will determine the syntax (.md for common markdown and .mdx for MDX).

## Deployment

The website is automatically deployed using Cloudfare Pages.
