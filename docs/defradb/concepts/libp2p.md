## Overview

libp2p is a modular system which helps in the development of peer-to-peer network applications. The system comprises of protocols, specifications, and libraries.

## What is Peer-to-peer?

Most commonly used peer-to-peer applications include file sharing networks like bittorrent (used to download movies, files) and the recent uptrend of blockchain networks. Both these network types communicate in a peer-to-peer method.

In a p2p network, participants (also known as nodes or peers) communicate with each other directly rather than using a **server** like the client/server model of data transfer.
